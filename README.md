# Tutorial: Capture Audio in C++

This repository stores the code that was written for the associated YouTube
tutorial series on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@chrisrouck).

## Release structure

The YouTube tutorial is split into two parts:

1. Capture realtime audio from the computer and display its left and right
   channels as volume bars in the terminal
    - **Video**: https://youtu.be/jpsJCji71Ec
    - **Source code**: https://github.com/chrisrouck/tutorial-cpp-audio-capture/releases/tag/v1.0.0
2. Gather frequency data from the audio capture and display it as a spectrogram
   in the terminal
    - **Video**: https://youtu.be/yt7i4zPbVDs
    - **Source code**: https://github.com/chrisrouck/tutorial-cpp-audio-capture/releases/tag/v2.0.0
